# Project Lavender

## Project Overview

This project is to generate all of the necessary hardware and code for a project that will use a load cell to measure the weight of a lavender plant in grams and integrate that information into an instance of home assistant.

This is a proof of concept for Gemini CLI to operate as a developer Lead and product manager.
